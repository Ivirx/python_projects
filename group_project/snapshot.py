# # Project Introduction:
# This project aims to analyze a dataset containing height and weight information, 
# obtained in metric units (centimeters for height and kilograms for weight).
# The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the main objective is to perform data exploration, 
# handle any missing values, extract meaningful insights, and visualize the data.

# # Project Steps:
# 1. Load and read the dataset using Pandas.
# 2. Handle any missing values to ensure data quality.
# 3. Extract meaningful statistical insights, such as correlation, range, variance, and skewness, 
# to understand the data distribution and variability.
# 4. Visualize the data using Matplotlib to present findings visually.
# Throughout the code, comments will explain each step for clear documentation and easy understanding.
